- client: 
	- has a process that initiates communication
	- communicates with server
	- don't communicate with eachother
- server: 
	- has a process that waits to be contacted
	- always-on host
	- permanent IP address
	- often in data centers
- IPC allows 2 processes within same machine communicate
- IP address + Port numbers 
- sockets:
	- processes sends / receives messages to/from its socket
	- btw application layer and transport layer there is a socket
	- there is sockets on both sides of processes
- file distribution
	- server transmission:
		- takes $\frac{F}{\mu_s}$ to send 1 copy, $\frac{NF}{\mu_s}$ to send $N$ copies
	- client:
		- takes $d_{min}$ client download rate, $\frac{F}{d_{min}}$
	- time to distribute $F$ to $N$ clients using client-server approach
		- $D_{cs} = max \{ \frac{NF}{\mu_s}, \frac{F}{d_{min}}\}$
		- $\frac{F}{d_{min}}$ cuz assume clients download in parallel
