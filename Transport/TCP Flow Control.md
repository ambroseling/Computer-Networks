- If network layer is deliver data faster than application layer removing data from socket buffers
- Anatomy of flow control:
	- network layer delivers IP datagram payload into TCP socket buffers
	- application layer removes data from TCP socket buffers
- Flow control: 
	- receiver controls the sender, so sender won't overflow receiver's buffer by transmitting too fast
	- on the TCP packet, we have a header field (receive window) indicating the # of bytes the receiver is willing to accept
	- TCP receiver "advertises" free buffer space in `rwnd` field in TCP header
	- the sender limits the amount of unACKed data it can send to the `rwnd` it receives from the receiver
