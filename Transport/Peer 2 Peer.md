- no always-on server
- arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
- intermittently connected and change IP addresses
- file distribution: 
	- server transmissions:
		- time to send 1 copy: $\frac{F}{\mu_s}$
	- client:
		- takes $\frac{F}{d_{min}}$ to download
	- time to distribute $D_{P2P} \ge \{\frac{F}{\mu_s},\frac{F}{d_{min}},\frac{NF}{\mu_s + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mu_i}\}$
		- $\frac{NF}{\mu_s + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mu_i}$: 
- Locating resources in P2P
	- Centralized Approach
		- client looking for resource asks the server
		- server sends address of peer that has the resource
		- client looking for resource contacts the peer
	- Fully Distributed
		- content can be found by flooding
		- not efficient in terms of bandwidth
		- may not find the content
	- Distributed Hash Table (distributed P2P database)
		- distributed database and an efficient search algorithm
		- stores `(key,value)` pairs, key: content type, value: IP address
		- peers query DB with key, DB returns values that match the key
		- use an integer to identify each peer in range $[0,2^n - 1]$
	- Circular DHT
		- each peer is only aware of immediate successor and predecessor
		- $O(N)$ messages on avg to resolve query if there are $N$ peers
		- can introduce shortcuts (each peer keeps track of IP of predecessor, successor and short cuts) $\rightarrow$ $O(log(N))$
- BitTorrent
	- file divided into 256Kb chunks
	- peers in torrent send/receive file chunks
	- **tracker**: tracks peers participating in torrent
	- **torrent**: group of peers exchanging chunks of a file
	- requesting chunks:
		- at any given time different peers have different subsets of file chunks
		- periodically asks peers for list of chunks they have
	-  sending chunks:
		- peer sends chunks to other peers currently sending her chunks at highest rate
		- every 30 seconds, randomly select another peer  and start sending chunks
