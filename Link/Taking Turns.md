### Polling
- master node invites other nodes to transmit in turn
- typically used with "dumb" devices (bluetooth)
- but there could be polling overhead, latency, single point of failure at master

### Token Passing
- control token passed from one node to next sequentially
- nodes hold on to token message
- but there could be token overhead, latency, single point of failure
