- network layer above IP: ICMP messages carried in IP datagram
- ICMP header
	- 8 byte header
		- 1st byte -> ICMP type
		- 2nd byte -> ICMP code
		- 3rd and 4th byte -> ICMP checksum of entire message
		- last 4 bytes -> remaining contents may vary
- only reports errors
- errors are always sent to original source, only info available in the datagram about route is source and destination address
- TraceRoute
	- source sends sets of UDP segments to destination
	- 1st set has TTL = 1, 2nd set has TTL = 2, 3rd set has TTL = 3
	- when ICMP message arrives at source we record the RTT
	- UDP segment eventually 
	- destination returns ICMP "port unreachable" message (type 3 code 3)
	- source stops
