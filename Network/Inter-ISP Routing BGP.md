Border Gateway Protocol 
- allows subnets. to advertise its existence and the destinations it can reach to rest of internet
- enables routing between Autonomous Systems
- it provides a means for Autonomous Systems to :
	- **eBGP**: 
		- obtain subnet reachability information from neighbouring Autonomous Systems
		- exchanges routing information between different Autonomous Systems, find best route for data travel
	- **iBGP**: 
		- propagate reachability information to all AS-internal routers
		- used by routers within the same Autonomous System

#### eBGP, iBGP
